# How are humidity and temperature related?
- the hotter the temperature; the more water air can hold
  - here; check; r/s; between humidity & temperature 
    - (linear// non-linear?; are there exogenous variables? *potentially pressure; cited in many sources)

Plot 1 day; 15 mins interval; see if humidty & temperature; fluctuate much
  - at different sites
```{r}
readings1 %>% 
  filter(type %in% c("TPH.RH", "TPH.TEMP"),
         date == ymd("2020-01-26")) %>% 
  arrange(hour, min, site_id) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date_time,
      y = value,
      colour = type)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~site_id)
```
- RH & temperature; fluctuate a lot; in 15 minutes time frame
- across all locations; similar trend
- 12pm go up to slightly pass midnight; go down till 12pm
  - sharp decline in the morning; ***possibly sunrise
  *https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/australia/melbourne?month=1&year=2020
  - add; line @ sunrise & sunset
- as temperature increase; RH decrease
  - amount of water; air can hold increase; so if absolute humidity stays the same; then RH decreases
  
- NOT GOOD plot; temp in celsius// RH; in %

Average temp & average RH; over time  
- since; same trend; across all locations
```{r}
# readings across all sensors
readings_avg <- readings1 %>% 
  filter(type %in% c("TPH.RH", "TPH.TEMP")) %>% # filter to 15 mins reading
  # sumamrise readings across all sensors; every 15 mins
  group_by(date_time, type) %>% 
  summarise(mean_readings = mean(value))

readings_avg_wide <- readings_avg %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = type,
              values_from = mean_readings)

lm(TPH.RH ~ TPH.TEMP, data = readings_avg_wide)

# plot RH against temp (facet by month)
readings_avg_wide %>% 
  mutate(month = lubridate::month(date_time)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = TPH.TEMP,
                 y = TPH.RH)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  # add linear line
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  # facet by month
  facet_wrap(~ month,
             nrow = 4)

# plot RH against temp (overall)
readings_avg_wide %>% 
  mutate(month = lubridate::month(date_time)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = TPH.TEMP,
             y = TPH.RH)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  # add linear line
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") 
```

- see that; as temperature increases; RH decreases
  - temperature increase; make you feel hot
  - similarly; RH increase; make you feel hot
  - theres trade off; temperature decreases; you'll still a little "hot/humid" because RH increases// and vice versa

```
RH
- relatively humidity; ranges from 55.30 to 75.48
- *note: used 2019 values; for November & December
  - weirdly; RH; below 60
  - otherwise; in 2020; rh; between 60.43 & 75.48; relatively stagnant
- mean: 65.6
  
Temp
- Not as much variation as I thought
- mean: 15.3
